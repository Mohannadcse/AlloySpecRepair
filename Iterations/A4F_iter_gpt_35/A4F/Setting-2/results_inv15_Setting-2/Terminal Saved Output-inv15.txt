Agent: Below are the results from the Alloy Analyzer.Fix all Errors and Counterexamples before sending me the next <FIXED_SPECIFICATIONS>. Executing command [Check inv15_Repaired] of the proposed Alloy model, Alloy analyzer found a counterexample, indicating assert inv15_Repaired is violated by this counterexample:
Teacher={Teacher0}
Student={Student0, Student1}
Person={Student0, Student1, Teacher0}
Person.Tutors={Student0->Student0, Student0->Student1, Student1->Student0, Teacher0->Student1, Teacher0->Teacher0}
Person.Teaches={Student0->Class2, Student1->Class0, Student1->Class1, Teacher0->Class2}
Group={Group0, Group1, Group2}
Class={Class0, Class1, Class2}
Class.Groups={Class0->Student1->Group0, Class0->Student1->Group1, Class0->Student1->Group2, Class1->Student0->Group0, Class1->Student0->Group1, Class1->Student0->Group2, Class1->Teacher0->Group0, Class1->Teacher0->Group1, Class1->Teacher0->Group2, Class2->Student1->Group0, Class2->Student1->Group1, Class2->Student1->Group2}
Compiling the proposed Alloy model generates a compilation error at Line None, Column None: & is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = {this/Student} Right type = {this/Teacher} generates a compilation error at Line 1 column 494 The join operation here always yields an empty set. Left type = {this/Class} Right type
= {this/Person->this/Class} generates a compilation error at Line 1 column 503 & is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = {none} Right type = {this/Teacher}

Executing command [Run repair_pred_1] of proposed Alloy model, Alloy analyzer generates a valid instance, indicating the model is consistent and pred repair_pred_1 is satisfied.
Compiling the proposed Alloy model generates a compilation error at Line None, Column None: & is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = {this/Student} Right type = {this/Teacher} generates a compilation error at Line 1 column 1147 & is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = 
{this/Student} Right type = {this/Teacher}

Executing command [Run repair_pred_1] of proposed Alloy model, Alloy analyzer generates a valid instance, indicating the model is consistent and pred repair_pred_1 is satisfied.
Compiling the proposed Alloy model generates a compilation error at Line None, Column None: & is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = {this/Student} Right type = {this/Teacher} generates a compilation error at Line 1 column 1268 & is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type =

Agent: Below are the results from the Alloy Analyzer.Fix all Errors and Counterexamples before sending me the next <FIXED_SPECIFICATIONS>. Compiling the proposed Alloy model generates a compilation error at Line None, Column None: & is irrelevant because the two subexpressions are always disjoint. Left type = {this/Student} Right type = {this/Teacher}
generates a compilation error at Line 1 column 2063 ^ ~ (this/Person <: Teaches) is redundant since its domain and range are disjoint: {this/Class->this/Person} generates a compilation error at Line 1 column 2062 The join operation here always yields an empty set. Left type = {this/Person} Right type = {this/Class->this/Person} generates a compilation
error at Line 1 column 2058 Subset operator is redundant, because the right subexpression is always empty. Left type = {this/Teacher} Right type = {none}
