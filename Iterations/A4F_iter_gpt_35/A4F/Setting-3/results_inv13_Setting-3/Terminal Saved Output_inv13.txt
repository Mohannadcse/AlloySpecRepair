```pred inv13 { Tutors.Teacher in Student.Tutors }```

This modification ensures that only teachers tutor and only students are tutored, resolving the compilation error related to the disjointness of types.

The error in the Alloy model can be fixed by modifying the predicate inv13_OK to correctly define the relationship between tutors and students. Specifically, the predicate should be updated to: "pred inv13_OK { Tutors.Person in Teacher and Person.Tutors in Student }". This modification ensures that only teachers tutor and only students are tutored.

The error in the Alloy model can be fixed by removing the '&' operator in the 'inv3' predicate, as it is unnecessary due to the disjoint nature of the types. Additionally, the 'inv4' predicate can be modified to ensure that the set of Persons includes both Students and Teachers by changing it to 'Person = Student + Teacher'.

To fix the error in the Alloy model, update the predicate inv13_OK to correctly define the relationship between Tutors and Person as Tutors.Person in Teacher and Person.Tutors in Student. Additionally, revise the assertion inv13_Repaired to reflect this correction by modifying the iff condition to match the updated predicate.

To fix the error, you need to modify the predicate inv13 as follows: replace "and" with "&" in the expression "s not in Person.^~Tutors and t not in Person.^Tutors". This change will ensure that only teachers tutor and only students are tutored, resolving the compilation error related to the disjoint subexpressions.

The modifications needed to fix the error in the Alloy Analyzer report involve updating the predicate inv13_OK to correctly define the relationship between tutors and students. Specifically, the predicate should be modified to ensure that Tutors are of type Teacher and Person.Tutors are of type Student. After making this adjustment, recheck the repair_pred_1 predicate to validate the correction.

The modifications needed to fix the error in the Alloy Analyzer report involve updating the predicate inv13_OK to correctly define the relationship between tutors and students. Specifically, the predicate should be modified to ensure that Tutors are of type 
Teacher and Person.Tutors are of type Student. After making this adjustment, recheck the repair_pred_1 predicate to validate the correction.
