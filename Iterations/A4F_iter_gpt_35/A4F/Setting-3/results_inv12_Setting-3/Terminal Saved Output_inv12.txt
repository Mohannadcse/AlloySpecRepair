The error in the Alloy model can be fixed by ensuring that the predicate inv11 is modified to include a condition that a class has groups only if it has a teacher assigned. Additionally, the compilation error related to the disjoint types of Student and Teacher at Line 96 column 12 can be resolved by revising the expression to avoid the use of the & operator between these types.

The error in the Alloy model can be fixed by modifying the predicate `inv13` to ensure that only teachers tutor and only students are tutored. Additionally, the predicate `inv14` should be adjusted to guarantee that every student in a class is at least tutored by all the teachers assigned to that class.

The error in the Alloy model can be fixed by modifying the predicate `inv13` to ensure that only teachers tutor and only students are tutored. Additionally, the predicate `inv14` should be adjusted to guarantee that every student in a class is at least tutored 
by all the teachers assigned to that class.
**Trial 1:**

I will fix the predicates `inv13` and `inv14` as requested.

To fix the error, you should modify the Alloy model to ensure that the join operation between disjoint types does not yield an empty set. Specifically, revise the expressions involving the join operation at Line 1 column 471 and Line 1 column 480 to avoid the compilation errors related to the disjoint subexpressions.

To fix the error, you need to modify the predicate inv13 to ensure that only teachers tutor and only students are tutored. Specifically, update the predicate as follows: "pred inv13 { Tutors.Person in Teacher and Person.Tutors in Student }". This modification will address the compilation error related to the disjoint subexpressions of teachers and students.

To fix the error in the Alloy Analyzer report, modify the predicate inv12 to ensure that every teacher is responsible for some groups by changing the expression from "all t : Teacher | some c : Class | t->c in Teaches implies some p : Person, g : Group | c->p->g
in Groups" to "all t : Teacher | some (t.Teaches).Groups".
