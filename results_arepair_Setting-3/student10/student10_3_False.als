The  Analyzer reported the following error message:

Executing "Check repair_assert_1"
Solver: SAT4J
...
Counterexample found. Predicate "repair_assert_1" is not valid.

This indicates that the assertion `repair_assert_1` is not valid and a counterexample was found. This suggests that the `Sorted` predicate is overconstrained and needs to be adjusted.
